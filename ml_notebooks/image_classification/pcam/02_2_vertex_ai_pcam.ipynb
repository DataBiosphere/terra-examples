    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows some examples of how to use [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) for training a machine learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook `02_1_vertex_ai_pcam` showed how to define and submit a **model training job**; then how to upload and deploy that model for serving; and then how to send prediction requests to the deployed model's *Endpoint*. It also showed how to create and use a Managed Tensorboard instance during training, and how to log information about the training run to the Vertex Experiments API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to set up a [**hyperparameter tuning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) job using that same model; and how to set up and run a **distributed multi-node training** job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a following set of notebooks show how to use Vertex Pipelines to define an ML workflow for data preprocessing, training, model evaluation, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example code is here: https://github.com/verily-src/terra-solutions-ml.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimated cost of running this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for the examples in this notebook is fairly large, as is the base model architecture, and training using the notebook's default configurations will take a number of hours. Time estimates are added in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model training works best with GPU(s)— it runs fine using only CPUs, but training will take an even longer time. For this example, the notebook itself doesn't need GPUs; instead they'll be used by Vertex AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HP tuning example should cost ~37USD in Vertex AI charges to run (billed to your ['native' GCP project](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360051229072-Accessing-advanced-GCP-features-in-Terra)), and the distributed training example < 7.5USD in Vertex AI charges, not including the cost of the notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running on a [Terra](http://app.terra.bio) notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This example requires that TensorFlow >= 2.6 be installed, and does not require GPUs; instead the example uses GPUs on Vertex AI Training.\n",
    "You can use the default GATK image.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use a ['native' GCP project](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360051229072-Accessing-advanced-GCP-features-in-Terra) to connect to the Vertex AI services.  The `00_pcam_setup.ipynb` notebook, which should be run before this one, will walk you through that setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "If you like, you can shut down the notebook instance/Cloud Environment while the training job runs— monitoring its progress in the Cloud Console UI— and then restart the notebook instance when the job is finished to complete the example. If you do this, you'll need to rerun the import and config cells at the start of the notebook before proceeding.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To monitor the logs for a training job while it is running, click on the links output to the notebook when you start the training job.  You can also visit the [Vertex AI tab in the Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training/custom-jobs) for your 'native' GCP project, and click on 'Training', then 'CUSTOM JOBS'.  From that list of jobs, click in to any of them— look for your username— then click on the 'Logs' link in the detailed view.\n",
