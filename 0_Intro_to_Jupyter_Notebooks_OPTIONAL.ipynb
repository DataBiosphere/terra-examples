    "Insights in biomedical research require data analysis, but complex analysis is hard to document, share and reproduce. Notebooks enable researchers to quickly develop a rich scientific document that conducts an analysis, shows the results, and explains scientific context. Each code cell of a notebook executes commands to manipulate and explore your data. Code cells can be written in Python, R, or other languages already familiar to the researcher. It is straightforward to expand the functionality of the source code by installing pre-existing libraries, packages or modules of code in a variety of languages. Markdown cells contain formatted explanatory text, links, and images to compliment code cells. Better than \"notes\", Julyter notebooks mean you will never have questions you can't answer because you forgot your exact analysis steps from eight years ago.\n",

Seeing and executing the actual code tells so much more. Further, when others query your notebook, they can poke around, and even build on your findings.
